# Ion Installer

## What is Ion?  
#### Ion is an Arch installer that aims to be simple, straightforward, and bloat-free.
  
  
## How can I modify or run a local instance of Ion?   
  
#### It's pretty easy. First of all, make sure you have NPM and NodeJS installed using:  
`npm -v` and `node -v`. If they throw an error, install NodeJS and NPM. 
  
  
## NodeJS and NPM installation

#### Arch installation: `sudo pacman -S nodejs npm`  
  
#### Debian installation: `sudo apt install nodejs npm`  
  
#### RHEL/Fedora/CentOS installation: `sudo dnf install nodejs npm`  

#### MacOS installation (assuming you have brew): `brew install node`. If you do not have brew installed, run the following: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`  
  
#### Windows installation: Download the latest installer from https://nodejs.org/en/#home-downloadhead
  
   
## Running Ion
#### Running Ion is pretty straightforward. Run the following: `npm init --yes && npm start` in the Ion directory and you have Ion locally running!
#### Feel free to modify the code as you want!
