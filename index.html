    <h1>Welcome to the Ion installer!</h2>

<div class="text-area">
    <h3>What is Ion?</h2>
    <p>Ion is a simple installer for Arch Linux. It is made in Electron, and the source code will be available soon! Arch Linux doesn't need to be hard and confusing. Arch can be for everyone! </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Why should I use Ion over other installers?</h3>
    <p>Because it is clean, straigforward, and does not install any bloat. A lot of installers add a bunch of uneeded software on your system, and their interfaces are outdated. Ion is here to change that.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Why should I use Ion over an Arch based distribution?</h3>
    <p>A lot of Arch based distros install a bunch of bloat (uneeded software) and do not have as many options. In Ion you can choose the Desktop Environment, the Bootloader, and even the Kernel! It's all in your hands.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Can I use the Ion code for my own project?</h3>
    <p>Of course you can! It is licensed under MIT, which you can find here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meisme-dev/Ion-Installer/main/LICENSE.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>So come on! Install your own Arch system now!</h3>
